! merge 3 new 4 !

ALL:
* csv to csv,tsv throughout
* rid of explicitly passing around os.Stdout in all various help functions, annoying
* het.dkvp > het.json in more places
* check each page for adequate h2 coverage

* deduping pass!
* 1-up/0-up -> one-up/zero-up everywhere

* flags-doc
  C refactor cli-parser w/ LUT & help strings
  C refector mlr help w/ mlr help flags
  c reorg manpage a bit
* top-of-page jargon-check for each one
? i would LOVE to have small prev-page/next-page links at the *top* not bottom ...

record-heterogeneity:
? current csv-reader code handles this? i think not. check csvlite-reader too.
? --allow-ragged-csv-input: link to new flags page once it's written
l link-to's:
  shapes-of-data.md: instead, use the following
  csv-with-and-without-headers.md.in:## Regularizing ragged CSV
  misc-examples.md.in:Then, join on the key field(s), and use unsparsify to zero-fill counters
  questions-about-joins.md.in:To fix this, we can use **unsparsify**:
  two-pass-algorithms.md.in:There is a keystroke-saving verb for this: [unsparsify](reference-verbs.md#unsparsify)
  programming-language.md.in:easy for you to handle non-heterogeneous data
  two-pass-algorithms.md.in:Suppose you have some heterogeneous data like this:
? back out of ref section -- ?

csv-with-and-without-headers:
? Headerless CSV with duplicate field values -> typo-fix -- duplicate keys actually -- ?!?
? cat out nas.csv first
? ag -> just grep ?
l Miller handles compliant CSV: include rfc4180 link
? Regularizing ragged CSV: use regularize verb?!?

special-symbols-and-formatting:
? mlr --icsv --odkvp --ofs '\001'  cat commas.csv | cat -v
  o test this
  o look for unbackslash callsites in the C impl
  o SeparatorFromArg
? How to escape '?' in regexes? -> still true? link to torbiak297?

dates-and-times:
? Caveat: localtime-handling in timezones with DST is still a work in progress -- fixed by torbiak?

shell-commands:
e while-read example from issues

statistics-examples:
C 2nd card no output b/c stats1 --fr

two-pass-algorithms:
l link to "new" verbs x everywhere possible
e section-renames for consistency
x this (or wherever ...) maybe get rid of some of the too-many examples. pick some survivors; x the rest.

reference-verbs:
E data/colored-shapes.dkvp (this page & throughout) a CSV file ...
* ... I ONLY READ UP TO CUT & PAUSED ...

reference-main-data-types:
E field values are usually strings -> update
E Field values are treated as numeric for the following: -> update
? Miller's types for function processing are -> add JSON null; & check for others (array/map)
E true/false -> add info about NaN and Inf et al.
!! very much missing stuff!! where's the listing of mlrval types?!?
  - reference-dsl-variables.md.in should link to it
  - ditto programming-language.md.in
c UTs for r"a" . r"b" and so on and so on

reference-dsl-variables.md:
? IFLATSEP & OFLATSEP -- ?

reference-main-null-data:
? more variants of is_... ?
? Records with one or more empty sort-field values sort after records with all sort-field values present -> apparently not true for sort -nr
e split out h2's
! spell out JSON-null

reference-main-arithmetic:
? test stats1/step -F flag
? The following, however, produce integer output if their inputs are integers: + - * / // % abs ceil floor max min round roundm sgn. As well, stats1 -a min, stats1 -a max, stats1 -a sum, step -a delta, and step -a rsum produce integer output if their inputs are integers. -> test all

reference-main-regular-expressions:
? regular expressions (of type POSIX.2) -> check/update; also link to Go page
d separate escaping for "\t" etc in arg-2/regex position -- "\t"."\t" example as well ...

reference-dsl-control-structures:
e while (NR < 10) will never terminate as NR is only incremented between records -> and each expression is invoked once per record so once for NR=1, once for NR=2, etc.
E C-style triple-for loops: loop to NR -> NO!!!
? or if a same-name variable is present in outer scope then it is modified. -> check that and make sure there is a UT
l Since uninitialized out-of-stream variables default to 0 for addition/substraction and 1 for multiplication when they appear on expression right-hand sides (not quite as in awk, where they'd default to 0 either way) <-> xlink to other page

reference-dsl-user-defined-functions:
E User-defined subroutines -> non-factorial example -- maybe some useful aggregator
l link to --load and --mload

reference-dsl-builtin-functions:
c mlr: option "--list-all-functions-as-table" not recognized. Please run "mlr --help" for usage information -> fix
! ... need to proofread entire list ...

reference-dsl-output-statements:
E Keep in mind that out-of-stream variables are a nested, multi-level hashmap (directly viewable as JSON using dump), whereas Miller output records are lists of single-level key-value pairs -> link to flatten page
  - old: You can emit any map-valued expression, including `$*`, map-valued
    out-of-stream variables, the entire out-of-stream-variable collection `@*`,
    map-valued local variables, map literals, or map-valued function return
    values.
  - new: mlr: lashed-emit node types must be local variables, field names, or oosvars; got map literal.
  c ?make FunctionCallsite an Emittable? does this work in the BNF?
? Use --oflatsep -> check -- jflatsep, iflatsep, oflatsep as --csv/--icsv/--ocsv -- ? what was the thinking at the time?
? mlr --oxtab put -q --oflatsep / '
  o 2 examples not 3?
  o why not '--oflatsep /' respected?

diffs other langs:
e slice incl/excl; split-in-half: x[:2] x[2:] vs x[:2] x[3:]
e localvars in if/else

separators:
E write up which file formats support which flags
